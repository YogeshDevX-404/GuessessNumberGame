## 🧠 Core JavaScript Logic (Main Focus)

This project is designed to strengthen **JavaScript fundamentals**, especially:

- Random number generation using `Math.random()`
- Conditional logic (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Event handling (`addEventListener`)
- DOM manipulation
- Input validation
- Game state management (win / lose conditions)

## ⚙️ How the Game Works

1. JavaScript generates a **random number** within a fixed range.
2. User enters a number and clicks **Check**.
3. The program:
   - Compares user input with the generated number
   - Gives feedback:  
     - 📉 Too Low  
     - 📈 Too High  
     - ✅ Correct Guess
4. Game ends when the correct number is guessed.
5. User can **restart the game** and try again.
